Draft Introduction/Summary for Daylily
(Note: I have embedded comments/suggestions below in double parentheses “((…))” for your consideration.)

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have revolutionized clinical genomics by enabling rapid and cost-effective generation of massive volumes of data. Yet, the process of selecting, comparing, and deploying the computational tools required to transform raw sequence data into biologically and clinically actionable findings remains extraordinarily challenging. Tools such as sequence aligners

e.g.,Manta(Chenetal.2016), and workflow executors e.g., Snakemake (Köster & Rahmann 2012), Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al. 2017) are heavily used but rarely evaluated under standardized, transparent conditions. Daylily is designed to address this gap by offering a reproducible, cost-aware, and hardware-explicit framework for end-to-end bioinformatics analyses—from raw data to variant calls—with emphasis on transparency, consistency, and benchmarking.

Rationale and Challenges
Lack of Transparent and Standardized Benchmarks
For many tool developers and researchers, there is a perceived fear that head-to-head comparisons could “look bad” if their tool underperforms on certain metrics. Consequently, many publications and workflows either omit direct comparisons or use simplified/obscure metrics like an aggregated F-score that glosses over context-specific performance (e.g., tool “X” may have excellent precision but middling overall F1, or vice versa).

Such practices limit the field’s ability to thoroughly assess which tool is optimal for a specific use case.
Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) reference datasets

Zooketal.2019 represent a comprehensive standard for small variant detection in various genomes (e.g., NA12878, NA24385, etc.), yet many published comparisons fail to include these critical benchmarks.
((Suggestion: Possibly give a brief overview of the GIAB sample set here, if space allows, to emphasize why it’s so crucial.))
Inconsistent and Often Irreproducible Cost and Runtime Assessments
Reproducible results in terms of variant calling or alignment accuracy alone have become easier to achieve through containerization and improved workflow management. However, reproducibility of runtime and cost remains elusive. For many labs, the computational resources needed to run a pipeline can vastly affect whether a particular tool is viable, particularly if it requires specialized hardware such as GPUs or proprietary accelerators like Dragen.

Even open-source workflows may be prohibitively expensive in certain cloud environments if the hardware is not explicitly accounted for in the design.
((Comment: Here you might add an example illustrating how two identical pipelines can have very different costs depending on instance types or ephemeral storage costs.))
Over-Reliance on “Best Practices” That Quickly Become Obsolete
Despite rapid advances in algorithms and hardware, the field often clings to “best practices” from leading institutions or tool authors, even when such practices are not rigorously updated or benchmarked. While frameworks like GATK were once considered the “gold standard,” many studies have demonstrated improved or more targeted accuracy with newer approaches. Without a transparent comparative ecosystem, “best practices” can remain static for years.

((Comment: The statement regarding “best practices” being potentially unethical in clinical settings might need to be phrased carefully, depending on the audience’s tolerance for strong language.))
Divergent Workflow Managers and Cluster/Container Complexities
Snakemake, Nextflow, CWL, and many other workflow engines each have passionate advocates. In truth, these managers mostly address reproducibility of outputs (i.e., ensuring the same commands are run on the same data). They do not inherently guarantee reproducible performance in terms of runtime or cost, especially in dynamic scheduling or container-orchestrated environments.

Daylily leverages the powerful features of Snakemake Köster & Rahmann 2012 but keeps the door open for alternative systems by providing an infrastructure-as-code approach for cluster provisioning, job scheduling, and cost tracking.
Need for Explicit Hardware Selection and Infrastructure-as-Code
Historically, each laboratory or institution maintained a unique (sometimes “snowflake”) high-performance computing cluster, making it difficult to reproduce analyses outside that environment. Now, cloud computing offers on-demand scaling, but also introduces a bewildering array of hardware and service options—some open, some proprietary.

Daylily provides a consistent hardware environment (built on AWS using infrastructure-as-code with Terraform and Slurm) that researchers can instantiate and tear down repeatedly with minimal effort.
By eschewing deeply proprietary add-ons (where possible) and focusing on Slurm-based scheduling, Daylily aims to preserve a level of hardware agnosticism, thereby facilitating reproducibility on non-cloud or other cloud platforms.
((Suggestion: If you intend for Daylily to be easily portable to GCP or Azure in the future, consider clarifying any known dependencies that might need reconfiguration.))
Persistent Cost Tracking and Analysis
A key innovation in Daylily is integrating cost analysis (and potentially real-time cost gating) directly into the workflow. In many bioinformatics projects, cost is an afterthought, but it can be the decisive factor in clinical and research contexts. Daylily’s design ensures that cost data are collected alongside runtime and accuracy metrics, enabling users to optimize not only for performance but also for budget.

((Comment: You might detail the mechanism for real-time cost gating here—e.g., hooking into AWS billing APIs or Slurm job costing.))
Reliance on a Shared Filesystem Approach
Many genomic tools (e.g., MultiQC, structural variant callers) rely on scanning a common filesystem for outputs and intermediate files. Kubernetes-based solutions can complicate such workflows unless a parallel filesystem or distributed volume is overlaid to mimic a shared resource. Daylily’s emphasis on Slurm and AWS FSx for Lustre addresses these workflow needs cleanly, leveraging high-performance parallel I/O while mirroring data to S3 for persistence.

The Daylily Framework
Daylily is an open source blueprint that integrates the following components into a cohesive, reproducible system:

Infrastructure: Automated provisioning of an AWS-based Slurm cluster using Terraform, including FSx for Lustre as the shared, high-performance filesystem.
Workflow: A Snakemake-based analysis pipeline that can be extended or swapped out for other managers, enabling flexible tool integration and versioning.
Cost and Runtime Monitoring: Built-in hooks to track compute costs (per job, per instance type) and runtime metrics.
Benchmarks and Standards: Inclusion of GIAB datasets

Zooketal.2019 for robust variant-calling comparisons, along with recommended standard metrics (precision, recall, F1, etc.) to capture both global and subset-specific performance (e.g., calling accuracy in difficult genomic regions).
Reproducibility: Container-based runtime for tool versions plus pinned AWS machine images ensure that performance benchmarks can be re-created and validated by external parties.
((Comment: If you like, you can expand on each bullet with more details. I kept them concise here.))

Conclusion
Daylily aspires to foster a culture of open, rigorous tool assessment in clinical genomics. By tying together reproducible hardware environments, robust cost and runtime monitoring, standardized benchmarking datasets, and community-driven workflow frameworks, it directly addresses a longstanding need for clarity and accountability in bioinformatics tool selection. We invite the community to explore, critique, and contribute to Daylily’s roadmap, ensuring that future developments in genomic data analysis are both innovative and transparent.
