# Sequencing Platform Comparison

| Platform            | Coverage for SNP F1 ≈ Illumina 30× | Indel Detection (Small vs Large) | SV Detection | Cost per Genome (2024) | Projected Cost (2029) | Strengths & Weaknesses |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Illumina (Short-Read)** | ~30× for ~99% SNP F1 (baseline) | Small indels: high F1 (≈98–99% in high-confidence regions). Large indels: poor detection beyond ~50 bp | Limited SV detection (paired-end reads detect some SVs, but low recall ~55% F1) | ~$600 (30× WGS) (NovaSeq X optics ~$200) | ~$100–200 (aiming for ~$100 genome) | **Strengths:** High per-base accuracy (Q30+), mature pipelines for SNP/indels. **Weaknesses:** Short reads miss many SVs and complex variants; variant calling accuracy drops in repetitive/hard regions. |
| **PacBio HiFi (Long-Read)** | ~20× HiFi for Illumina-comparable F1 (~99%) | Small indels: excellent F1 (~99%), even in homopolymers. Large indels: excellent detection (long reads span them) | Strong SV detection (calls most SVs with high precision, F1 ≈96.7% at 20×) | $1000 (30×); *$500 at 20×* with new Revio+SPRQ chemistry | ~$300–500 (expected with higher throughput) | **Strengths:** Long and highly accurate reads (15–20 kb) yield best-in-class small and large variant accuracy. Captures complex variants and SVs missed by short reads. **Weaknesses:** Higher cost (though falling), lower throughput than short-read platforms; longer turnaround. |
| **Oxford Nanopore (ONT)** | ~50–60× to match Illumina SNP F1 (30× ONT ≈97% F1) | Small indels: good, but lower F1 (homopolymer errors reduce indel accuracy). Large indels: excellent detection (ultra-long reads span large variants) | Excellent SV detection (ultra-long reads enable ~93% SV F1 at 60×). Especially good for very large or complex SVs. | ~$350–$500 (30× WGS) | ~$100–150 (planned higher yields) | **Strengths:** Longest reads (up to Mb) for resolving large SVs and haplotype phasing; real-time sequencing; also detects methylation directly. **Weaknesses:** Raw read accuracy lower (~99% per read with newest chemistry, improved but slightly below HiFi), requiring higher coverage for equal SNP/indel precision. Indel errors (esp. homopolymers) persist, though new R10.4 pores and basecallers mitigate this. |
| **BGI/MGI (DNBSEQ)** | ~30× for Illumina-like performance (short-read accuracy comparable to Illumina) | Small indels: high F1 (on par with Illumina). Large indels: poor (short reads, similar limits as Illumina) | Limited SV detection (comparable to Illumina short-read capabilities) | ~$300–$600 (30× WGS; significantly lower per-Gb cost than Illumina) | ~$100 (high-throughput platforms enable ~$100 genome) | **Strengths:** Similar data quality and accuracy as Illumina, but lower sequencing cost per gigabase (e.g. ~$6/Gb vs $10+/Gb Illumina). Emerging ultra-high-throughput sequencers (T20×2) can do 30× <$100. **Weaknesses:** Short reads share Illumina’s limitations in SV/large indel detection; global adoption limited by patent/export issues rather than technical performance. |
| **Ultima (UG100)** | ~30× for high accuracy (designed for 30× $100 genome; claims on-par SNP F1 99.8%) | Small indels: excellent (99.4% F1 reported). Large indels: poor via reads alone (short ~300 bp reads limit large indel detection, similar to other short-read platforms) | Limited SV detection (short reads only; no paired reads, so primarily can rely on coverage or assembly methods) | ~$100 (30× WGS) | ~$50 (projected with increased throughput) | **Strengths:** Ultra-high throughput ($1 per Gb) enables ~$100 genomes, with accuracy comparable to Illumina for SNVs/indels. Uses novel flow-based sequencing on a spinning silicon wafer for low reagent cost. **Weaknesses:** Reads ~300 bp (short-read limitations for SVs and repeat resolution). New platform — fewer established workflows and possible unknown biases; currently single-end reads (lack paired-end context for structural variant inference). |
