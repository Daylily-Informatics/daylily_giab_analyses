# Comparison of Sequencing Technologies

| Metric | Illumina 2×250 (30×) | PacBio HiFi (HiFi Long Reads) | Oxford Nanopore (Long Reads) |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Coverage for SNP F1 ≈ Illumina 30×** | 30× (baseline) | ~15× HiFi needed (DeepVariant at 13.7× HiFi yields SNP F1 0.9957, comparable to Illumina 28–30×) | ~30× needed with new Q20+ reads (30–40× ONT achieves SNP F1 ≈0.996–0.997, comparable to Illumina). Lower coverage (<20×) significantly reduces SNP accuracy. |
| **Indel calling ability** | Excellent for small indels (F1 ~0.99+ in high-confidence regions). Struggles with large indels > read length or in complex repeats. | High accuracy for small–medium indels (HiFi reads achieve Indel F1 ~0.97 with advanced variant callers). Some residual errors in long homopolymers, but adding short reads can rescue these. Can detect larger indels spanning up to read length (tens of kb). | Moderate for small indels: higher error rates in homopolymer and repeat regions (Indel F1 ~0.79 overall vs 0.997 for Illumina in easy regions; only 0.676 in long homopolymers). Outside homopolymers, indel accuracy improves (~0.975 F1). Strong for large indels: long reads capture large insertions/deletions that short reads miss. |
| **Structural variant (SV) detection** | Limited – reliable for some deletions (up to ~86% of deletions detected) but poor for insertions (~22% sensitivity). Short reads miss many SVs > read length or in repetitive regions. | Excellent – Long reads improve SV discovery ~3× over short reads. HiFi reads (15–25 kb) capture most SVs >50 bp with high precision. Near parity with assembly-based methods for SV detection. | Excellent – Ultra-long reads can span very large SVs and complex rearrangements. With improved callers (e.g. Sniffles2), ONT SV sensitivity ~90% for deletions and ~74% for insertions, outperforming Illumina. Capable of detecting virtually all SV types (inversions, translocations, etc.) present in read span. |
| **Current cost per genome (2024/2025)** | ~$300–600 in reagents at scale (NovaSeq X can deliver ~$200 per genome at full capacity, though typical services ~$500+ including overhead). | ~$1000 in consumables for 30× WGS (PacBio Revio list price $995 per 30× genome). High-capacity systems can approach ~$1000/genome; older SMRT sequencing was higher ($2–3k). | ~$1000 per 30× genome (one PromethION flow cell per genome). Cost varies with output – e.g. if one flow cell (~$1000) yields 2 genomes, cost ~$500 each. Smaller devices (MinION) have lower up-front cost but may require multiple flowcells for a human genome. |
| **Projected cost per genome (5-year)** | ~$100–200 or less. Illumina and new entrants aim for the “$100 genome.” Ultima Genomics has demonstrated ~$100 per genome sequencing, and Illumina’s NovaSeq X already hits $200. Continued innovation likely drives costs to ~$100. | ~$500 or less. PacBio plans <$500 per HiFi genome (the new SPRQ chemistry increases output, enabling ~$500/genome). In 5 years, high-throughput HiFi could approach a few hundred dollars per genome as yield improves and instrument capacity grows. | ~$500 or less. ONT is expected to reduce cost via higher throughput (more Gb per flow cell) and new devices. While ONT hasn’t publicly set a price target, improvements in pore chemistry and output per run could make a human genome on ONT a few hundred dollars (especially as competition pushes all providers toward ~$100 genomes). |
| **Library prep cost & analysis** | Library Prep: ~$100 per sample for standard WGS prep; simple workflow (PCR-free prep available, <1 day). Analysis: Mature, fast pipelines (e.g. BWA/GATK, or DRAGEN FPGA). Compute cost is modest (a few dozen CPU-hours, <$50) and often bundled in sequencing service. | Library Prep: Higher complexity – requires high molecular weight DNA (10+ µg). Kit cost a few hundred dollars per sample, and prep can take 1–2 days including DNA extraction. Analysis: Basecalling/CCS generation is computationally intensive but done on instrument or compute cluster; variant calling (DeepVariant, etc.) requires similar compute to Illumina. No PCR needed. | Library Prep: Options for rapid prep (e.g. transposase-based <1 hour) or ligation kit (~2 hours), with cost ~$100 per genome. Requires high molecular weight DNA for best results. Analysis: Computationally heavy – raw signal needs basecalling (often GPU-accelerated). Full analysis (basecall + alignment + variant calling) can take 2200 CPU-hours ($100 cloud cost) for 30–40× data. ONT provides real-time basecalling options (MinIT/GPUs) to reduce turnaround. |
| **Gains vs Illumina 30×** | – (baseline) | Long-read advantages: Access to GC-rich, low-mappability, and repetitive regions inaccessible to short reads. ~3× more SVs detected. Highly accurate HiFi reads (Q30) give near-Illumina small variant accuracy. Enables phasing of variants over megabase scales (haplotype-resolved reads). Can directly detect epigenetic marks (e.g. DNA methylation) in the sequencing data. | Long-read advantages: Ultra-long reads can resolve structural variations and large repeats that others miss. Better SNP recall in low-complexity and unmappable regions (ONT SNP F1 was 0.987 vs 0.944 for Illumina in low-mappability regions). Comprehensive SV detection (captures large insertions that short reads miss). Can phase SNPs/indels and SVs simultaneously over very long ranges. Directly reads native DNA/RNA and detects modifications (5mC, 6mA) from signal. Portable sequencing possible (MinION). |
| **Limitations vs Illumina 30×** | – (baseline) | Limitations: Higher cost per Gb (though improving) and lower throughput than Illumina for large projects (Revio yields ~90 Gb per run = 1 genome per SMRT cell). Sample prep requires ultra-pure HMW DNA. Slightly lower indel precision in homopolymers – needs polishing with short reads for maximum small-indel accuracy. Read lengths (~15–25 kb) while long, are shorter than ONT’s ultra-long; extremely long repeats (e.g. centromeres) may still remain unresolved. | Limitations: Raw read accuracy still lower – especially prone to small indel errors in homopolymer runs, requiring higher depth or hybrid error correction. Yield per flow cell can be variable; achieving consistent 30× from one flow cell may require optimization. Data analysis is more complex (basecalling adds an extra step). Some biases (e.g. lower accuracy in very GC-extreme regions or systematic errors in specific motifs) still exist. Overall SNP/indel precision slightly lower than Illumina at equivalent coverage (more false positives without short-read polishing). |
